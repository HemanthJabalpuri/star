this is Lua script to extract files made using Motorola singleimage tar utility(star).

Currently, only star tool that we can find from some of blankflash files(eg. [this](https://mirrors.lolinet.com/firmware/motorola/river/blankflash/blankflash_from_QPUS30.52-23-4.zip)) and [imjtool](http://newandroidbook.com/tools/imjtool.html) can unpack these Motorola singleimage tar utility made files having SINGLE_N_LONELY magic as far as I know. But I guess these are not Open Source.
